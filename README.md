I read in an image and converted it to an HSV image, since I wanted it to detect the cones based on color. I then created a range of values that make red and created a mask that is applied to the HSV image to isolate red areas, which could be potential cones. I then got all the contours of the isolated areas and iterated through all of them. Through the iterations, I checked the size of the contour to see if it would fall in what I approximated was the size of the cones. If they did fall in the range, the centroid of the contour was calculated and placed into either the left or right array, which corresponded to which half of the image they were positioned in. I then sorted the centroid positions based on the y-axis so that the line is drawn from the bottom up. I then used those points to find the best fit line (slope and intercept) to create a regression line. I first tried to make the contours on a grayscale image and was going to try to get the contours of the cones based on location, but I realized too many contours were there to the point where it was unable to isolate just the cones. I also tried to get rid of some of the contours based on where they were located on the image. However, the cones were not positioned in a pattern where I could simply make a range and check if they fell into it. It also required a lot of hard-coded values, which I didn't want. The libraries I used were OpenCV, NumPy, and Google Colab Patches.
